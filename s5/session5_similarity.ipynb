    "We will now start from the DTM that was generated as the 200 articles you saw previously. This is a labelled dataset where the data comes from a very small subset of a larger dataset that is unlabelled. The context is that we labelled a part of the data and then use this training to spot similar articles in the larger set. In order to prepare for that task, I have split a larger dataset into training and test set. We will first do everything on the training set and then get to the test set when we do supervised learning.\n",

    "The training_set.csv below is pre-processed but not vectorized. This notebook tries to show how different vectorizations and similarity methods shown in class affect what a query on an article returns. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will see also that comparing by the dot product is a risky idea - run the notebook entirely, go through and then discuss with your neighbor. In the end the tf-idf vectorization together with cosine similarity will yield the best fit to the article. Experiment a little with a different article.\n",
